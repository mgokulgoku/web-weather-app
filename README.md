# Weather App

Simple weather checker that shows current weather for any city.

## What it does?

- Type city name and get weather info
- Shows temperature, weather condition, and humidity
- Works for cities anywhere in the world

## Built with

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data

## How to use?

Open weatherapp.html, type a city name, click "Get Weather".

## What I learned?

- How to use APIs with JavaScript
- Working with JSON data
- Basic error handling
- Making the layout look decent

The API part was confusing at first but I got it working eventually.

## Files

- weatherapp.html - main page
- style.css - styling  
- script.js - JavaScript code

## Future ideas

- Add weather forecast
- Show weather icons
- Maybe add current location

Pretty basic but it works and I learned a lot about APIs!
